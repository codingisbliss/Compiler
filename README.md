	#[SOLVED] *** CAN BE TAKEN AS *
	#[SOLVED]alpha numeric are cuasing some ERRor
	#[BUG] = SIGN CREATING PROBLEM
	#[BUG]handle +++ or +<space>
	#[UNSOLVED]unary vs minus Operator fix
	#[SOLVED]symbol tAble class inheritance
	#[UNSOLVED]I do not want to assume a particular end-of-line convention (CR on old Macs, NL on Unix/Linux/Mac OS, CR LN on Windows)----.  
	Would be best to write code that does not care.
	#[SOLVED]you have to put a limit on the length of IDs (no arbitrarily long IDs).-----  
	you limit should not be more than 80.  ifthe scanner sees an ID of length more tha the limit, it should process it, 
	complain about it in a ERROR message, and then truncate it to the limit.
	#[NOTKNOWN]formfeeds 
	#[SOLVED]or the purposes of this part of the project, COMMENT is a token.  They should show up in the test output----
	  But build in a switch to turn it off, so that they are just silently ignored, for later parts of the project.
	#[UNSOLVED]be able to read a file for input, or standard input
	#[UNSOLVED]each time there is a problem, it has to output the line number, character positions (start and finish) of the problem
	#[UNSOLVED]Support the operation next()
	#[NOTSOLVED]next() operation to advnace the scanner.  if scanner sees errors, it complains about them to standard output, skips them, and keeps going.  
	#it does NOT report them to the caller (we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this in class)
	#[UNSOLVED] add error msg to symbol table:

Download three files :

1. Scanner.py
2. token.py
3. abc(input test file have to be changed for general stdio)
